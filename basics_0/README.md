- [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)
- Different types of network
- LAN network
- WAN network
- Internet
- MAC address
- What is an IP address
- Private and public address
- IPv4 and IPv6
- Localhost
- TCP and UDP
- [TCP/UDP ports List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers)
- What is ping / ICMP

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external help:

### OSI Model
- What it is
- How many layers it has
- How it is organized

### Networking Basics
- What is a LAN and its typical usage and size
- What is a WAN and its typical usage and size
- What is the Internet

### IP Addressing
- Types of IP addresses (private and public)
- What is localhost
- What is a subnet
- Why IPv6 was created

### TCP/UDP Protocols
- Differences between TCP and UDP
- Commonly used ports (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS)
- Tools/protocols to check network connectivity
