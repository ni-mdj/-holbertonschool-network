### Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

#### General Networking Concepts
- **What is localhost/127.0.0.1?**  
  Localhost is a hostname that refers to the local machine. The IP address `127.0.0.1` is the loopback address, commonly used for testing and development.

- **What is 0.0.0.0?**  
  The IP address `0.0.0.0` is a non-routable meta-address used to specify an invalid, unknown, or non-applicable target. It often indicates that a server is listening on all available IP addresses.

- **What is /etc/hosts?**  
  The `/etc/hosts` file is used to map IP addresses to hostnames. It is a simple way to configure local name resolution.

- **How to display your machineâ€™s active network interfaces?**  
  You can use the command `ifconfig` or `ip addr` to list the active network interfaces on your system.

### Commands and Tools
The following commands are essential for this project:

- **ifconfig:** Displays network interfaces and their configurations.  
- **telnet:** A tool used to communicate with remote devices via TCP.  
- **nc (netcat):** A versatile networking utility for reading and writing data across networks.  
- **cut:** Used to extract sections from each line of files.
